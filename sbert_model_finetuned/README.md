# SentenceTransformer based on sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2

This is a [sentence-transformers](https://www.SBERT.net) model finetuned from [sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2). It maps sentences & paragraphs to a 384-dimensional dense vector space and can be used for semantic textual similarity, semantic search, paraphrase mining, text classification, clustering, and more.

## Usage

### Direct Usage (Sentence Transformers)

First install the Sentence Transformers library:

```bash
pip install -U sentence-transformers
```

Then you can load this model and run inference.
```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

# Download from the ðŸ¤— Hub
model = SentenceTransformer("sentence_transformers_model_id")
# Run inference
sentences = [
    'ive been experiencing a lot of problems with my bowel motions recently its difficult to go and it hurts when i do my anus is quite painful and it has been bleeding whenever i go its excruciatingly painful and im quite uneasy',
    'my bowel motions are giving me a lot of problems right now going is difficult and going hurts when i do it when i go my anus bleeds and is really uncomfortable im in a lot of discomfort and it hurts extremely bad',
    'i have asthma like symptoms like wheezing and difficulty breathing i often get fever and have headaches i feel tired all the time',
]
embeddings = model.encode(sentences)
print(embeddings.shape)
# [3, 384]

# Get the similarity scores for the embeddings
similarities = model.similarity(embeddings, embeddings)
print(similarities)
# tensor([[1.0000, 0.9616, 0.4749],
#         [0.9616, 1.0000, 0.4977],
#         [0.4749, 0.4977, 1.0000]])
